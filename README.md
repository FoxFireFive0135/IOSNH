# IOSNH
Official repo for IOSNH (Insert Operating System Name Here)

I reccomend using qemu-system-i686

### !!WARNING!!
Don't even think about compiling this with WSL. From what i've found it will NOT work with WSL or cygwin or the other windows linux stuff.


##### anyways...
IOSNH is my wonderful hobby os that is on its 8th attempt. This one seems to be going quite well!

The ISO is compiled with a program that shows the "functionality" of the keyboard, its awful.

I've compiled this under Ubuntu with the i686-elf-gcc cross-compiler https://wiki.osdev.org/GCC_Cross-Compiler
